Radiographs of the spine may be useful to detect lytic lesions, which are more likely to be associated with osteosarcoma (vertebral lymphosarcoma is rarely detectable radiographically).Nutritional hyperparathyroidism should be considered as an infrequent cause of spinal cord disease in cats, 18 Spinal trauma causes peracute/acute neurological signs, which usually remain static (nonprogressive) or improve over time; however, in the first 24-72 h worsening of the neurological signs can be noticed due to secondary spinal cord hemorrhage/ischemia or edema.Lateralization of neurological signs is reported, depending on the lesion site.The most common neoplasm affecting the spinal cord of cats is lymphosarcoma, followed by vertebral column neoplasia secondarily affecting the spinal cord, 12-15 meningioma, 14, 16 and glial cell tumours 14, 17 ( Table 2) .Age seems to be associated with the prevalence of certain tumor types: cats younger than 5 years of age are significantly more likely to be affected by lymphosarcoma, usually with a shorter duration of neurological signs and multiple spinal cord segment involvement.36 Spinal trauma is an important cause of spinal cord dysfunction in cats.8, 9 Neurological signs usually relate to a focal lesion, which might be seen on spinal radiographs; in a traumatised cat, however, there may be multiple lesions affecting the spine and/or spinal cord, including ischemia, compression, hemorrhage and laceration.Congenital malformations, which can be symmetrical or asymmetrical, should be one of the differentials for a kitten/ young cat.Metabolic diseases causing neurological deficits compatible with spinal cord localizations are rare.There are no idiopathic diseases of the spinal cord recognized in cats.Typically, neoplastic conditions are chronic progressive diseases, although acute and subacute onsets of neurological signs and/ or spinal pain are relatively frequent.âœœ Spinal cord localization The four segments into which the spinal cord is clinically divided (C1-C5, C6-T2, T3-L3, L4-S3) are responsible for specific neurological signs when affected by disease processes (Table 1 ).Corticosteroid administration decreases the white blood cell count and/or total protein levels; 22 therefore, evaluation of CSF in pretreated cats may give false negative results.Fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy Vascular disease, although a relatively uncommon disease type per se, 30,31 is the fourth most common cause of spinal cord dysfunction in cats.23Lymphosarcoma has historically been considered to be the most common neoplasm affecting the spinal cord of cats and this has recently been reaffirmed by two large studies of cats with different spinal cord diseases.And cats with spinal cord pain were four times more likely to have abnormal MRI results than cats without spinal pain.30, 31 Cats with fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy typically present with a peracute/acute onset of asymmetrical spinal cord-related signs, which may progress over the first 24 h. 30 Spinal palpation does not elicit pain, and any spinal cord segment may be involved, although the intumescences are most frequently affected.
