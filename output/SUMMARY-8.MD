outbreaks with little prior preparation,195 these moral lenses become important since they can help people develop
 an other-centric orientation and sensitivity to the needs of others.To systematically drive the importance of a pe
ople-centered approach to pandemic influenza, this chapter explicated the biological make-up of the influenza virus
 as well as the social and global features of the associated pandemic.But considering the limitations associated wi
th antiviral drugs as well as vaccines in relation to combating pandemic influenza, some form of non-therapeutic ap
proach is necessary, at least as some adjunct to mitigate the overall impact of pandemic influenza on the local and
 global human community.Responding to influenza vaccine safety signals during a pandemic constitutes a scientific a
nd public health policy issue since decision-makers must balance the immediate consequences of disease against unce
rtain risks.116 One of the consequences of the therapeutic uncertainties associated with pandemic influenza is the 
validity of administering potentially ineffective antiviral drugs with side-effects or vaccines that may cause harm
 to people.In addition, it is widely believed within the scientific community that influenza pandemics can hardly b
e halted, but they can be delayed.137 Therefore, the “ignorance gap” that occurs during pandemic influenza outbreak
s creates a context in which some of the preparatory strategies will inevitably fail (due to no fault of anyone), t
hereby leaving some people less protected.In relation to the socioeconomic dynamics, it is estimated that most infl
uenza pandemic-associated deaths occur in poor countries or in societies with scarce health resources which are alr
eady stretched by extant health priorities and challenges.138 Farmer and Campos underscore the need for bioethics t
o engage the growing problem posed by the gap between rich and poor nations, and how such a course of action reflec
ts social justice .139 Politically, communist nations such as China present unique dimensions to the vulnerabilitie
s of pandemic flu as they may control critical information traffic and access to patients, thereby deepening the cr
isis situation,140 or misrepresenting it, and thereby subjecting the rest of the connected world to avoidable risks
.The biological make-up of human beings both make them vulnerable to becoming infected with influenza virus as well
 as make them good vectors of dissemination.On that note, it showed how people-centered lenses such as communitaria
nism and ethics of care may be useful in engaging the associated practical and moral challenges.To clarify the impo
rtance of each of these approaches, the chapter elaborated each of these ethical lenses, and showed how each may he
lp orient different players in the context of a pandemic influenza towards acquiring a sense of community and an ot
her-centric sensitivity which will be essential to resolving the moral dilemmas as well as realizing the critical p
ublic health objective central to such a public health disaster .In fact, vaccines are hardly enough during pandemi
cs, and rationing is generally considered as the ethical option.120 Yet, the contemporary interconnection between h
ealth, the right to health and human rights121 implies that withholding vaccines from some people who might be pote
ntial victims of a pandemic outbreak may be a human rights violation.The importance of this last remark will become
 clearer against the backdrop of the social and global features of pandemic influenza outbreaks, a. theme addressed
 in the next section of this chapter.An influenza pandemic has the potential to cause more deaths and illnesses tha
n any other public health threat.34 Influenza pandemics are characterized by a widely varying number of deaths,35 a
nd each outbreak has always underscored this notion.It may likewise create the dispersal of a virus novel to other 
continents that have experienced typical outbreaks.Geographical location plays a major role in public health,53 and
 disasters including health disasters are unique in that each affected region of the world has different social, ec
onomic, and health backgrounds.54 As such, while there is a global spread, the nature of each local context and how
 it responds shapes pandemic influenza in some key ways.Besides sore arm and redness at the injection site as well 
as red eyes which have been reported in earlier vaccine trials,78 there has been some association between increased
 incidence of narcolepsy in children and the use of the ASO3-adjuvanted vaccine for pandemic H1N1 influenza in Scan
dinavian countries.79 In addition, anecdotal reports of fetal deaths occurring shortly after vaccination emerged in
 2009 and raised public health concerns about vaccine safety.80 Another shortcoming associated with vaccination gen
erally is vaccine failure,81 which often creates a false sense of protection in recipients while allowing the conti
nued spread of infection .82 In relation to pandemic influenza specifically, vaccine failure was recently reported
