Taken together, these results suggest that transcriptional regulation of immune genes plays and important role in the immunity of channel catfish against bacterial infections.When the expression levels of the 27 genes at different time points after the first infection were compared to that after the second infection, significantly higher expression levels of these genes were induced by the first infection.Recently, He and coworkers (He et al., 2008 (He et al., , 2009 reported several cases of homologous recombination in influenza, their proposed recombination cases, however, suffer from the criticisms of 1) no phylogenetic support, 2) requiring parental sequences from substantially different geographic locations and time periods, 3) lone recombinant sequences and no circulating clades of recombinant viruses, and 4) unknown quality in sample-handling and sequencing (Boni et al., 2010) .7) , with significantly (P < 0.05) higher expression induced by the first infection at both time points.Serum lysozyme activity at various time points after the first infection was significantly (P Â¼ 0.005) higher than after the second infection (Fig.The PB2 protein has been shown to interact with the antiviral signaling protein (Graef et al., 2010) , affect host range (Subbarao et al., 1993; Labadie et al., 2007) and virulence of influenza viruses (Hatta et al., 2001; Shinya et al., 2004) .Recently, HRV-C was identified based on molecular typing studies (Ledford et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; McIntyre et al., 2013a Viruses had since revised the classification of HRV based on molecular typing results (Adams et al., 2013) .However, the expression levels of IL-1b was induced significantly (P < 0.05) higher by the first infection compared to that by the second infection (Fig.To date, there are only three peer-reviewed articles that have proposed the occurrence of intra-segmental homologous recombination in influenza A virus (Gibbs et al., 2001; He et al., 2008 He et al., , 2009 ) and each study has been criticized and challenged (Worobey et al., 2002; Boni et al., 2010) .In the first published recombination study, Gibbs et al.The need for a simple method of identifying HRV-C Despite delayed identification due to culture difficulties, studies suggest that HRV-C may cause more severe respiratory diseases than HRV-A or -B (McErlean et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2009; Bizzintino et al., 2011; Denlinger et al., 2011) .2017; Ma et al.Therefore, samples taken 7 to 10 days after infection may be negative for virus by isolation in cell culture but positive by hybridization.
