Unlike most disjunctions, this one yields a definite conclusion: Jay is in Sweden.The theory accounts for the informality of arguments in science and daily life, whereas logic is notoriously of little help in analyzing them.Shared mental models are critical for collaboration and agreement before intervening in a system.There are two models that an innovation in Health Security always needs to be cognizant of: The systems model that describes the wicked problem being addressed so that interventions can be designed, executed and monitored; the systems that describe the enterprise as discussed above in Forms of Innovation so that you understand how the two systems (and a larger system they are both part of) will interact.One last point about adopting a systems thinking approach and using systems and mental models for innovation is the ability to leverage systems archetypes [66].In the case of innovation, it is a systems thinking approach to value creation across business models, management models, organization models, operating models as well as the end products and services.It is keeping in mind and using all of the characteristics of innovation (forward thinking, new (or new use of) ideas, feasible, viable and valuable.For example, the iPod is often considered a disruptive product innovation, but the reality is that it was a totally new service-based business model, iTunes, that provided the success for the iPod and the eventual disruption of the media industry and the future creation of the smart phone market (and associated industry disruption) via its foundation as an App Store.From a systems perspective, products and services are the lowest level elements of the system, the most easily changed and, though critical and important, have the least impact on altering the system’s (enterprise’s) efficient and effective performance of its mission and achievement of its purpose in delivering value to its stakeholders.The organizational and managerial models provide the form of the enterprise including the structure (What the different parts of the operating model are and how they are put together) to the system (enterprise), clarity and specificity to the goal (mission, purpose, objectives, constraints) of the system (enterprise), the rules the operational level of the system (operational model of the enterprise) must follow, including the rules for changing all of the above.The organizational model is not just the structure of the organization, but the climates within it and the overall culture.Incorporating the potential (likelihood) of irrationality on the part of the stakeholders, as well as the futures researchers decision making [54].Lastly, foresight and futures researchers are encouraged to regularly assess how bias14 and logical fallacies15 may be entering their research before applying their conclusions into constructing future innovation planning scenarios.Intervening and innovation in the system associated with Global health security requires the following:Recognizing systems and systems thinkingMental models and problem framingDivergent thinkingDesign and experimentation (real time and foresight)Returning to Weick and Sutcliffe [1] ‘…unexpected events often audit our resilience, everything that was left unprepared becomes a complex problem, and every weakness comes rushing to the forefront’: the complex threat landscape associated with global health security matters requires a mindset that embraces innovation and creativity.10a).Systems thinking, approaching problems and asking how various elements within a system, which could be an ecosystem, an organization, or something more dispersed such as a health care system, influence one another, uses an iceberg model to describe the process.The Systems Thinker site has a good series of articles33 on how to get your organization to adopt systems thinking.This addresses the need to have a common language of innovation as discussed earlier.There are many ways to develop Systems Thinking within the organization.A systems model will also help identify all the interrelationships from which unintended consequences and unintended degrees of side effects occur.The systems models will help align the enterprise (the value creation system) with its “customers” (the value consuming system) within the context of their shared environment (the systems of all stakeholders).Begin to have meetings around diagrams, models, pictures instead of reports and spreadsheets.An excellent introduction to what a system is and how to think about it can be found at the Systems Thinker web site.16 It is beyond the scope of this chapter address all the concepts and issues of the systems paradigm, general systems theory, systems thinking, sensemaking, complexity, systems innovation and other concepts discussed here in more depth.Break through innovation is most often both a cause and an effect of industry (enterprises dedicated to a particular value proposition) or market (stakeholders with similar value needs and wants) consolidation.Disruptive product or service innovations, those which totally reinvent or create new industries or markets are usually the result of innovations at the higher levels of the system.Likewise, a common language about innovation, in particular recognize all potential stakeholders identified in future studies, helps avoid overly focusing on technological opportunities and immediate value creation to include less obvious social concerns, expectations and pressures that make up the wicked problems the innovation is attempting to address.Mental models are difficult to change and are one of the biggest barriers for innovation as they determine the level of assimilation of new ideas find and the level and quality of effort that will be put into them.
