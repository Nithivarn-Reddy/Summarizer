TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed to stimulate DCs most in the nasal mucosal immune tissue (Figure 6).To understand the nasal tissue activation caused by the TNF/CHP nanop
articles soon after immunization, we conducted gene expression profiling in NALT cells 6 h after nasal immunization with the IVV antigen combined with or without the 
nanoparticles.No obvious immunotoxicity was detected and the results suggested that TNF/CHP nanoparticles are relatively safe as a nasal vaccine adjuvant.The results 
of this study demonstrate that TNF/CHP nanoparticles are effective as a vaccine adjuvant when administered via the nasal mucosal route.The results show that the nasal
ly administered TNF/CHP nanoparticles combined with IVV induced significant levels of IgA in the nasal wash, as well as IgG1 in blood plasma (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).O
verall, our data demonstrate that TNF/CHP nanoparticles are effective as a vaccine adjuvant for nasally delivered IVV.Being focused on the nasal route of vaccination,
 we examined immune cells in the nasal tissues after the immunization.The TNF/CHP nanoparticles enhanced host immunity and the effect seemed stronger than that of CTB
, a vaccine adjuvant positive control.To directly address the stimulatory effect of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles on protective immunity as a vaccine adjuvant, we carried
 out an experimental lethal influenza virus challenge of immunized mice.The effects of the TNF/CHP nanoparticles seemed stronger than those of CTB.To directly address
 the use of TNF/CHP nanoparticles as a vaccine adjuvant on protective immunity, we employed a lethal influenza challenge mouse model.When administered the IVV, TNF/CH
P nanoparticles induced high levels of IgA in the nasal wash, as well as IgG1 in blood plasma (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)).The resulting Alexa-labeled OVA was used as an i
ndicator antigen for nasal administration to mice with or without the TNF/CHP nanoparticles as an adjuvant.These data suggest that TNF/CHP nanoparticles have the pote
ntial as a vaccine adjuvant with a broad range of applications.TNF/CHP nanoparticles elicited immune activation comparable to that of CTB (Figure 3(a)).There were no 
TNF/CHP nanoparticles and IVV-related changes observed (data not shown).The anti-IVV IgG1 in blood was examined after the administration of TNF/CHP nanoparticles and 
IVV.
