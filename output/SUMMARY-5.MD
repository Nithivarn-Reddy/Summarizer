More than five different resistance genes were found in 15 of the 17 strains and one strain harboured 11 of the 18 genes detected.Intermediate susceptibility (8.5% of all strains) and resistance (40.7% of all strains) to TC were found among isolates of all three species.Results: The results of the 60 penicillin resistant isolates are given in the following table:The highest MIC value of 256 lg/mL was found for ERY in 25% of the resistant isolates.The target region was amplified in PCR using DNA prepared from type strains as well as clinical isolates as templates.Methods: A total of 108 clinical strains of SPN were included in this study.Analysis of the isolates in the RAPD-PCR with primers previously used to type aspergilli revealed identity of the patient's isolates, whereas the reference strains were different.Results: The isolates were identified as: S. anginosus (53 strains), S. constellatus (five strains) and S. intermedius (one strain).In this study, the V1 and V2 signature sequences of 60 type strains of 54 different streptococcal species were determined.Objectives: Previous data has shown using S. pneumoniae (SP) strains with raised Co-a MICs that bacterial inoculum and strain MIC may impact significantly on the antibacterial effect measures (ABE).In 16 patients subsequent CSF testing was performed, six with positive and 10 with negative result of PCR.
