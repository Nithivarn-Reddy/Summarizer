M. haemominutum infection was documented in 3 cats with IMHA over 4 studies (1 study showing no association with IMHA),3, 51, 130, 140 yielding a median IME value of 2.16 and range of 0‐4.2.A high level of evidence was found that M. haemofelis causes IMHA in cats.Five studies documented 13 cases of IMHA in dogs infected with Babesia canis, with a median IME value of 3.20 and range of 0‐4.32.57, 104, 111, 128, 134 Babesia vogeli was documented in 2 studies of 5 dogs with IMHA, with IME values of 5.73 and 4.14.Immune‐mediated hemolytic anemia was documented in 69 dogs in 9 studies,93, 94, 95, 96, 99, 102, 103, 111, 151 with an additional study (in which the number of infected dogs with IMHA could not be determined) providing useful mechanistic insight.125 The median IME value was 5.32, ranging from 2.54 to 6.99.Four were studies of dogs experimentally infected with B. gibsoni, yielding a median IME value of 6.41 and range of 6.08‐6.99.94, 95, 96, 99 Natural infection with B. gibsoni occurs most commonly in fighting breeds.102, 125 However, mixed breed dogs used in experimental studies also develop IMHA, suggesting that the immune‐mediated pathogenesis is largely driven by the parasite.99 Whether other species of Babesia cause IMHA in dogs remains unclear.Six of the 9 cats were coinfected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV).138 Treatment for B. felis without immunosuppression resolved IMHA, yielding an IME value of 4.98.Although studies are limited, an intermediate level of evidence was found that B. felis causes IMHA in cats, and that treatment resolves IMHA without immunosuppression.Seven studies documenting IMHA in 21 cats infected with hemotropic Mycoplasma spp.The report of 2 of the cats with erythroleukemia suggests that diagnosis was based on bone marrow cytological or histological review, or both.3 The method of diagnosis of neoplasia was not described for the third cat with erythroleukemia.153 For the cats with non‐specified myeloproliferative disease, the diagnosis was based on bone marrow examination, but details are limited.110 All cats with non‐specified myeloproliferative disease were FeLV positive.110 The evidence for a causal association between erythroleukemia and IMHA is negligible, with an IME value for the 1 study in which it could be assigned of 1.87.3 Other studies of erythroleukemia or unspecified myeloproliferarative disease did not yield IME values because of the presence of comorbidities.A single cat with histiocytic sarcoma and IMHA was identified.3 This study did not show a causal association between IMHA and neoplasia, and the method of diagnosis of neoplasia was not described, yielding an IME value of 1.70.A single case of pancreatic carcinoma110 and a single case of anaplastic sarcoma3 with giant cells in cats with IMHA were identified.The evidence for a causal association between IMHA and lymphoma is low, with a median IME value of 3.54 and a range of 1.87‐4.24.A single cat with multiple myeloma and IMHA was identified.3 This study did not show a causal association between neoplasia and IMHA, and the method of diagnosis of neoplasia was unclear.For 3 additional studies, the number of dogs with Babesia and IMHA could not be determined.105, 125, 136 There is a high level of evidence that immune‐mediated destruction of erythrocytes contributes to anemia in dogs infected with B. gibsoni.The IME value for this study was 3.76.The evidence that A. phagocytophilum causes IMHA is low.Although no evidence for a causal link exists, cancer cannot be eliminated as a potential trigger for this disease.Eight cats for which an IME value could be calculated for lymphoma and IMHA were identified.3, 9, 164 Two of the 3 studies reporting these cases did not demonstrate a causal association between IMHA and lymphoma,3, 9 and 1 study was considered to partially report or suggest causality.164 The latter reports 2 sibling specific pathogen‐free experimental cats.
