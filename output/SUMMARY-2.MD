All DHHC proteins autopalmitoylate (Fukata et al., 2004; Huang et al., 2004; Lobo et al., 2002; Mitchell et al., 2006; Roth et al., 2002; Smotrys et al., 2005; Swarthout et al., 2005) , and autopalmitoylated PATs may represent covalent enzyme intermediates required for substrate palmitoylation (Hou et al., 2009) .Similar to neuronal synapses, many proteins in the TCR signaling pathway are palmitoylated and accumulate in lipid rafts, which coalesce and cluster at the IS following T cell activation (Bi et al., 2001; Burack et al., 2002) .Although it is clear that the palmitoylation status has a marked effect on lipid raft localization and function of T cell signaling molecules such as LAT, Src-family kinases (Lck and Fyn) and others, the importance of lipid raft localization is not fully understood.Although we do not yet know whether the selective hypopalmitoylation of LAT is the cause of T cell anergy, this is an intriguing possibility given the fact that downstream signaling events known to be impaired in anergic T cells such as Ras (Fields et al., 1996) , MAPK (Li et al., 1996) , NF-κB (Sundstedt et al., 1996) and AP-1 (Kang et al., 1992; Sundstedt and Dohlsten, 1998; Sundstedt et al., 1996) activation (Fathman and Lineberry, 2007; Schwartz, 2003) , are dependent on intact LAT function (Finco et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1999; Ouellet et al., 2003) .In seeking the mechanism that underlies LAT hypopalmitoylation in anergic T cells, we considered an imbalance in the dynamic and reversible process of LAT palmitoylation/ depalmitoylation.Although it is clear that LAT palmitoylation is required for lipid raft localization (Lin et al., 1999; Zhang et al., 1998b) , the role and importance of LAT palmitoylation in T cell development and activation has been a matter of some controversy.Indeed, recent studies demonstrated that T cells express two pools of LAT localized in the PM and the Golgi compartment and, furthermore, that mutation of Cys-26 and -29 leads to exclusive intracellular (Golgi) localization of LAT (Bonello et al., 2004; Hundt et al., 2009; Tanimura et al., 2003; Tanimura et al., 2006) .In fact, yeast 2-hybrid screens of PAT-interacting proteins identified interactors that were later found to represent true substrates of the relevant DHHC proteins (Fernandez-Hernando et al., 2006; Keller et al., 2004; Li et al., 2010; Nadolski and Linder, 2009; Saitoh et al., 2004; Singaraja et al., 2002; Uemura et al., 2002) .Some PATs have protein-protein interaction domains Mitchell et al., 2006) , and regions in palmitoyl proteins distant from their palmitoylated Cys residues, which are required for substrate recognition and palmitoylation, have been identified; furthermore, swapping of these recognition sequences between distinct palmitoyl proteins can confer new substrate specificity patterns (Greaves et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2009; Nadolski and Linder, 2009 ).A nonpalmitoylated PAG/Cbp mutant, which localized in the PM but not in lipid rafts, was still tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with Csk, Fyn and EBP50 but, nevertheless, unlike wild-type PAG, it did not block proximal TCR signaling (Posevitz-Fejfar et al., 2008) .Given that LAT is not expressed in B cells, a search for a LAT-like adaptor that may couple the antigen-specific B cell receptor (BCR) to downstream signaling pathways led to the discovery of non-T cell activation linker (NTAL) (Brdicka et al., 2002) , also known as linker for activation of B cells (LAB) (Janssen et al., 2003) , which, as implied by its name, is mainly expressed in non-T hematopoietic cells.Although CD4 and CD8αβ palmitoylation is not required for their transport or cell surface expression this localization enhances, in the case of CD4, raft aggregation, clustering of the TCR and PKCθ at the IS, and tyrosine phosphorylation of signaling proteins, primarily TCR-ζ and ZAP-70 kinase (Balamuth et al., 2004; Fragoso et al., 2003) .Earlier studies demonstrated defects in the activation of Ras (Fields et al., 1996) , MAPKs (Li et al., 1996) , and the transcription factors NF-κB (Sundstedt et al., 1996) and AP-1 (Kang et al., 1992; Sundstedt and Dohlsten, 1998; Sundstedt et al., 1996) in mouse and human anergic T cells, while TCR-induced Ca 2+ signaling remained relatively intact, the latter observation being consistent with an early report that treatment of primed T cells with a Ca 2+ ionophore can, in fact, induce T cell anergy (Jenkins et al., 1987) .
